The Home repository is the starting point for people to learn about Fody, the project.

Fody is an extensible tool for weaving .net assemblies. It enables the manipulating the IL of an assembly as part of a build requires a significant amount of plumbing code. This plumbing code involves knowledge of both the MSBuild and Visual Studio APIs. Fody attempts to eliminate that plumbing code through an extensible add-in model.
